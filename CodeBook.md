#  Activity Types
Measurements were recorded while subjects performed the following activities:

WALKING- ActivityID #1

WALKING_UPSTAIRS- ActiviyID #2

WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS- ActivityID #3

SITTING- ActivityID #4

STANDING- ActivityID #5

LAYING- ActivityID #6

# Subjects

Each SubjectID corresponds to a unique subject.


# Measurements
These measurements originally come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ, where t refers to time domain and Acc refers to acceleration. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.
Euclidean norm was used to calculate the magnitude.
Finally, a Fast Fourier Transform was applied to some signals to produce frequency domain data.

To improve readability, all measuresments have been written fully on the table without abbreviations. For each category there are only two of the original set of variables: Mean and Standard deviation.

Overall, the data consists of the mean and standard deviation of the following measurements:

Time-BodyAcceleration-XYZ

Time-GravityAcceleration-XYZ

Time-BodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ

Time-BodyGyro-XYZ

Time-BodyGyroJerk-XYZ
